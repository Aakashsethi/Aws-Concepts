**Project Overview:**

We are designing a cloud-based solution for a company that wants to develop a Spring Boot application and deploy it on AWS.
The application will need to interact with various AWS services such as EC2, IAM, and Lambda.

**Technical Requirements:**

The solution should be highly available and scalable.
The solution should be designed for security and compliance.
The solution should be cost-effective.

**Proposed Solution:**

To meet the technical requirements, we propose the following solution:

**EC2 Instance: **

will use an EC2 instance to host the Spring Boot application. 
will choose an instance type based on the application's requirements and performance needs.

**Auto Scaling: **
will use Auto Scaling to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on the application's demand. 
This will ensure that the application remains highly available and scalable.

**Elastic Load Balancer (ELB):**
will use an ELB to distribute traffic evenly across multiple EC2 instances. 
This will ensure that the application remains highly available and scalable.

**Lambda Function: **
will use a Lambda function to perform certain tasks that require serverless computing. 
For example, we can use a Lambda function to process data in real-time or to run a periodic job.

**AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM): **
will use IAM to manage access to AWS resources. 
will create roles and policies that provide the necessary permissions to access AWS services and resources.

**AWS Security Services:**
will use AWS security services such as AWS Security Hub, AWS GuardDuty, and AWS Config to monitor the environment and detect security issues. 
This will help us ensure that the solution is secure and compliant.

**AWS Cost Optimization Services: **
We will use AWS Cost Explorer and AWS Trusted Advisor to monitor costs and optimize the solution for cost-effectiveness.
This will help us ensure that the solution is cost-effective.

**Conclusion:**
The proposed solution will meet the technical requirements by providing a highly available, scalable, secure, and cost-effective environment 
for hosting the Spring Boot application. By using AWS services such as EC2, Auto Scaling, ELB, Lambda, IAM, and security and cost optimization services,
we can ensure that the solution is designed for performance, security, and cost-effectiveness.
